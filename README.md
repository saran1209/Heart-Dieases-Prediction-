# Abstract
<p>Over the last few decades, heart related diseases are the main reason for a large-scale death in the world and has emerged as the most life-threatening disease. By which there is a need of reliable, accurate and feasible system to diagnose such diseases in time for proper treatment. Every year a lot of data is being generated by the Medical Industry. This data can be utilized by researchers for several machine learning techniques that help in the prediction of heart related diseases.  we will be running different ML algorithms and conclude which one them is the most effective.</p>
